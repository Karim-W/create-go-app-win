# create-go-app-win

i hate windows and i will not make the main app backwards compatible, cry about it idc

## Depenencies

Windows is a lovely (horrible) OS that does not have the basic utility tools like git and it command line tools suck so be nice and use coreutils

## CoreUtils

> YOU MUST HAVE [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) INSTALLED

run this to install it

```bash
cargo install coreutils
```

## Git

come on dude

link can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Install

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/karim-w/create-go-app-win
```
